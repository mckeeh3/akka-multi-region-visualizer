        <h2>How to Use the UI</h2>
        <p>
          The Akka Multi-Region Grid Demo provides a visual interface for interacting with a distributed grid of cells. Each cell can be in one of six states: default (empty) or color (red, green,
          blue, orange, predator).
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Interactions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Changing Cell States</strong>: Hover over any cell and press one of the following keys:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="key">r</span> - Set cell to <span class="color-box red"></span> red</li>
              <li><span class="key">g</span> - Set cell to <span class="color-box green"></span> green</li>
              <li><span class="key">b</span> - Set cell to <span class="color-box blue"></span> blue</li>
              <li><span class="key">o</span> - Set cell to <span class="color-box orange"></span> orange</li>
              <li><span class="key">p</span> - Set cell to <span class="color-box predator"></span> predator</li>
              <li><span class="key">d</span> - Set cell to default (empty)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cell Information</strong>: Cells display the elapsed time (in milliseconds) since they were last updated. This value is calculated as the difference between the
            <code>viewAt</code> and <code>updatedAt</code> timestamps. These timestamps are recorded before the durable I/O operations, so they represent the actual time taken to replicate the entity
            state change across regions and prior to updating the view row in each region.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Grid Summary</strong>: The top of the grid shows a summary of the total number of cells in each state.</li>
          <li><strong>Connection Status</strong>: The top bar shows the current connection status and the server endpoint being used.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grid Navigation:</h3>
        <p>
          The grid visualizer implements an <strong>infinite grid viewport</strong> concept. Think of the grid display as a window or viewport into a much larger grid that extends in all directions.
          The visible cells represent just a small portion of this larger grid, and you can navigate to view different grid locations.
        </p>
        <p>Your current position in the grid is displayed at the top of the grid area as "Grid Position: x=X, y=Y", where X and Y are the coordinates of the top-left cell of your viewport.</p>

        <h4>Navigation Commands:</h4>
        <p>You can navigate the grid using vim-like keyboard commands. Simply type a number followed by one of the command keys:</p>

        <h5>Absolute Positioning:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="key">100x</span> - Move to X-coordinate 100 (sets the left edge of the viewport)</li>
          <li><span class="key">-50y</span> - Move to Y-coordinate -50 (sets the top edge of the viewport)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Relative Movement:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="key">50h</span> - Move left 50 units (like vim's h key)</li>
          <li><span class="key">30j</span> - Move down 30 units (like vim's j key)</li>
          <li><span class="key">20k</span> - Move up 20 units (like vim's k key)</li>
          <li><span class="key">40l</span> - Move right 40 units (like vim's l key)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Notes on Navigation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>All movements are rounded to the nearest 10 units for alignment consistency</li>
          <li>The grid has boundaries at ±1,000,000 in all directions</li>
          <li>As you type a command, it appears in the info panel at the top</li>
          <li>Press <span class="key">Escape</span> to cancel a command in progress</li>
          <li>Relative movement commands (h/j/k/l) only accept positive numbers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advanced Features:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>URL Parameters</strong>: You can customize the polling interval by adding <code>?interval=X</code> to the URL, where X is the interval in milliseconds (default is 2000ms). The
            <code>routes="region1,region2"</code> (see the <code>application.conf</code> file for more details).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The grid automatically adjusts to your screen size, showing as many cells as possible while maintaining readability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Box Selection for Multi-Cell Updates</h2>
        <p>The grid visualizer includes a powerful box selection feature that allows you to update multiple cells simultaneously:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Enter Selection Mode</strong>: Hold down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. You'll see a status message indicating "Selection mode active" and the cursor will change to a
            crosshair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Select a Region</strong>: While still holding <span class="key">Shift</span>, click on a cell that will be one corner of your selection, then move to the opposite corner. As you
            move the mouse pointer, you'll see cells highlighted with a dashed outline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apply Color</strong>: With cells selected (still holding <span class="key">Shift</span>), press one of the color keys:
            <ul>
              <li><span class="key">r</span> - Set all selected cells to <span class="color-box red"></span> red</li>
              <li><span class="key">g</span> - Set all selected cells to <span class="color-box green"></span> green</li>
              <li><span class="key">b</span> - Set all selected cells to <span class="color-box blue"></span> blue</li>
              <li><span class="key">o</span> - Set all selected cells to <span class="color-box orange"></span> orange</li>
              <li><span class="key">d</span> - Clear all selected cells (default)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Release Selection</strong>: After applying a color, or when you release the <span class="key">Shift</span> key, the selection will be cleared.</li>
        </ol>

        <br />
        <h2>Circular Multi-Cell Updates</h2>
        <p>
          Another way to perform multi-cell state changes is with a circular generation. Position the mouse pointer on any cell, then enter a number followed by one of the color keys. The mouse
          position is the center of a circle with a radius of the number entered (in cells). For example, <code>10r</code> will attempt to propagate the red color state to all cells within a circle of
          radius 10. There are two generation modes: <strong>span</strong> and <strong>fill</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fill Mode:</strong> If the center cell is empty, an attempt is made to set all empty cells within the circle to the specified color. Fill mode does not alter cells that are already
            in a different color state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Span Mode:</strong> If the center cell has a color, an attempt is made to update all other color state cells in the circle to match. Span mode does not alter cells that are empty.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> When the center cell's state is altered, the corresponding Akka SDK entity emits eight events—one for each of its neighboring cells:</p>
        <pre style="font-size: 0.95em; background: #101825; color: #a7ecff; border-radius: 6px; padding: 8px; line-height: 1.2em">
            NW   N   NE
               \ | /
            W -- C -- E
               / | \
            SW   S   SE
        </pre>
        <p>
          An Akka SDK consumer component receives these events and sends a <em>fill</em> or <em>span</em> command to each neighbor entity. Each entity then decides whether to accept the command based
          on the command type and its own current state. This process can repeat recursively, allowing the color to propagate outward in a circle. As the neighbors receive the command, they may emit
          events for their own neighbors, and the process continues until the circle is fully propagated or until no more cells can be altered.
        </p>
        <p>This mechanism enables rapid propagation of color changes in circular patterns, supporting both contiguous fills and color state region spanning, depending on the starting cell's state.</p>

        <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> This feature is particularly useful for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Testing multi-region replication with a large number of cells at once</li>
          <li>Creating patterns to visualize replication behavior</li>
          <li>Comparing replication times across different regions</li>
          <li>Stress-testing the system with many simultaneous updates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Tip:</strong> When using box selection or circular generation in a multi-region deployment, try selecting large areas in one region and observe how quickly the changes propagate to
          clients connected to other regions. The elapsed time numbers will help you visualize the replication latency across your distributed system.
        </p>

        <h2>Clear Color and Erase Colors Multi Cell Update</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Color (<span class="key">c</span> command):</strong>
            When you press the <span class="key">c</span> key while hovering over a colored cell, the system clears (sets to empty) that cell and all directly adjoining cells that share the same color
            state. The clear action propagates recursively to neighboring cells with the same color, stopping at boundaries between different colors or empty cells. This is useful for quickly removing
            a contiguous region of a specific color.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Erase Colors (<span class="key">e</span> command):</strong>
            When you press the <span class="key">e</span> key while hovering over a colored cell, the system clears (sets to empty) that cell and all adjoining cells, regardless of their color. The
            erase action propagates recursively to all neighboring colored cells, removing all color states in the connected region. This is useful for wiping out any colored area, regardless of color
            boundaries.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Both commands use a propagation mechanism similar to the circular fill/span commands: when a cell is cleared or erased, it emits events to its neighbors, which may in turn clear or erase
          their own neighbors, allowing the action to spread efficiently across the grid.
        </p>

        <h2>Predators and Prey</h2>
        <p>
          The grid simulation includes a dynamic predator-prey ecosystem that demonstrates event-driven entity behavior in a distributed system. Predators hunt and consume prey cells (colored cells)
          in an autonomous, event-sourced process.
        </p>

        <h4>Creating Predators:</h4>
        <p>
          To create a predator, position your mouse over any cell and type a number followed by the <span class="key">p</span> key. For example, <code>30p</code> creates a predator with an initial
          energy/range of 30 at the current mouse position.
        </p>

        <h4>How Predators Hunt:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Scent Following:</strong> Predators detect and follow the "scent" of prey cells. Larger clusters of colored cells emit stronger scents, attracting predators more effectively.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Predators move one cell at a time in the direction of the strongest scent. Each move consumes one unit of energy/range.</li>
          <li><strong>Consumption:</strong> When a predator moves into a prey cell, it consumes the cell (changing it to empty) and gains energy based on the prey's color.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Prey Energy Values:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="color-box red"></span> Red cells: 1 energy unit (weakest scent)</li>
          <li><span class="color-box orange"></span> Orange cells: 2 energy units</li>
          <li><span class="color-box green"></span> Green cells: 3 energy units</li>
          <li><span class="color-box blue"></span> Blue cells: 4 energy units (strongest scent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Predator Lifecycle:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Survival:</strong> Predators must consume prey to survive. If a predator's energy/range reaches zero, it dies.</li>
          <li><strong>Starvation:</strong> If no prey cells are within range, the predator dies from starvation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> When a predator's energy level reaches a certain threshold, it can spawn child predators, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical Implementation:</h4>
        <p>
          Predator movement is implemented through Akka SDK's event-sourced entity behavior. When a predator moves to a new cell, it receives information about its next move target through entity
          events. These entity events are processed by a consumer component that emits commands to the predator entity. The consumer processes predator move events by first retrieving the prey cells
          within range, and then determining the direction of the cells with the strongest scent. The consumer then sends a move command to the predator entity, which includes the next cell after the
          move in the direction of the strongest scent. This creates a fully autonomous, event-driven process that demonstrates the power of event sourcing in distributed systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          The predator-prey simulation provides a visual demonstration of how event-sourced entities can create complex, autonomous behaviors in a distributed system. Watch as predators hunt across
          the grid, making decisions based on the state of surrounding cells, all coordinated through behavior of the Akka SDK components in a multi-region distributed system.
        </p>

        <h2>Grid Cell Information Overlays</h2>
        <p>
          Each cell in the grid displays a number representing the elapsed time in milliseconds (<code>elapsedMs</code>). This value provides a real-time measurement of entity state replication and
          view update latency in the Akka SDK multi-region architecture.
        </p>

        <p>The visualizer provides two types of detailed information overlays for grid cells:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Timing Overlay (Press <span class="key">t</span> or hover):</strong> This overlay appears either when you press the <span class="key">t</span> key while hovering over a cell, or
            automatically after hovering over a cell for a short period. It displays:
            <ul>
              <li>Cell ID</li>
              <li>Processing times for each stage of the update pipeline:</li>
              <li>Endpoint to entity processing time</li>
              <li>Entity to view processing time for each region</li>
              <li>A visual graph showing the relative timing differences between regions</li>
            </ul>
            This overlay is particularly useful for visualizing cross-region replication latency, as it shows how quickly updates propagate from the primary region (where the entity is hosted) to
            other regions in the distributed system.

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em">
              <img src="/static/images/help-cell-timings-overlay.png" alt="Cell Timings Overlay" width="500px" />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cell State Details Overlay (Press <span class="key">q</span>):</strong> When you hover over a cell and press the <span class="key">q</span> key, a detailed overlay appears showing
            all state information for that cell, including:
            <ul>
              <li>Cell ID and coordinates (x, y)</li>
              <li>Current status (color)</li>
              <li>Timestamps for client request, endpoint processing, entity creation, updates, and view updates</li>
              <li>Elapsed time between updates</li>
              <li>Region information (where the entity was created, updated, and where the current view is located)</li>
            </ul>
            This overlay provides comprehensive information about the cell's current state.

            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em">
              <img src="/static/images/help-cell-state-overlay.png" alt="Cell State Overlay" width="500px" />
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These overlays provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the Akka SDK multi-region architecture, allowing you to visualize exactly how state changes propagate through
          the distributed system and measure the latency between different regions.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding Elapsed Time Display:</h3>
        <p>
          Each color state cell displays a number representing the elapsed time in milliseconds (<code>elapsedMs</code>). This value provides a real-time measurement of replication and view update
          latency in the Akka SDK multi-region architecture. The process works as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Entity Update (Primary Region):</strong> When a client updates a grid cell, the primary Akka SDK entity for that cell (located in one region) sets its <code>updatedAt</code> state
            attribute to the current time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View Row Update (Primary Region):</strong> This entity state change triggers an update of the related view row, which sets its <code>viewAt</code> attribute to the current time.
            The <code>elapsedMs</code> value is calculated as <code>viewAt - updatedAt</code> and stored in the view row.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Replication to Other Regions:</strong> Each entity state change is replicated to other regions. When the entity is updated in another region, it triggers a region-local view row
            update. <em>The entity's <code>updatedAt</code> is not changed during replication.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View Row Update (Replicated Region):</strong> The local view row in the replicated region is updated, setting its own <code>viewAt</code> to the current time and recalculating
            <code>elapsedMs = viewAt - updatedAt</code> using the original <code>updatedAt</code> from the primary region.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Elapsed Time Meaning:</strong> As a result, the <code>elapsedMs</code> for each grid cell reflects the time taken to replicate the entity state change across regions and update the
            view row in each region. This includes cross-region replication time and any processing delay in updating the view.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> The elapsed time is calculated as the difference between the <code>viewAt</code> and <code>updatedAt</code> timestamps. These timestamps are recorded before the durable I/O
          operations, so they represent the actual time taken to replicate the entity state change across regions and prior to updating the view row in each region.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach provides a real-time visualization of distributed system latency and cross-region replication performance. When you see a cell's elapsed time, it shows how long it took for an
          update in the primary region to be reflected in the current region's view.

        <h3>Key Components:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Event Sourcing</strong>: Each cell is an Event Sourced Entity (<code>GridCellEntity</code>) that maintains its state through events.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Views</strong>: The <code>GridCellView</code> component provides two ways to access the data:
            <ul>
              <li><code>getViewList</code>: Returns a snapshot of all cells as a list</li>
              <li><code>getViewStream</code>: Provides a real-time stream of cell updates</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTTP API</strong>: The <code>GridCellEndpoint</code> exposes these capabilities through HTTP:
            <ul>
              <li><code>/grid-cell/view/list</code>: HTTP endpoint to get all cells</li>
              <li><code>/grid-cell/view/stream</code>: Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for real-time updates</li>
              <li><code>/grid-cell/update-status</code>: HTTP PUT endpoint to update a cell's status</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Client-Side Integration</strong>: The JavaScript client uses:
            <ul>
              <li>HTTP fetch for initial state and polling updates</li>
              <li>EventSource API for real-time SSE updates</li>
              <li>HTTP PUT requests to send updates to the server</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Optimizations</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Cell updates only occur when the status actually changes</li>
              <li>The server avoids persisting events when setting a default cell back to default</li>
              <li>Both polling and streaming are used for maximum reliability</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability</strong>: This architecture can scale to handle thousands of concurrent users and cells, as Akka's distributed nature allows entities to be spread across multiple
            nodes.
          </li>
